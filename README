Memoize-Attrs version 0.00_03
=============================

NAME
    Memoize::Attrs - Add memoization with subroutine attributes

SYNOPSIS
        use Memoize::Attrs;

        sub slow_function :MEMOIZE {
            ...
        }
        # slow_function is memoized and faster 

DESCRIPTION
    Memoization is a wonderful thing when appropriate. And memoization is a
    nice optimization trick that may be applied after some thought and
    experimentation. With the "Memoize" module, that means to invoke
    "memoize" after declaring the subroutine in question.

    But that said, memoization looks like a trait and should be added
    without much fuss. That trivial module makes is possible by annotating
    subroutine definitions with an attribute "MEMOIZE".
